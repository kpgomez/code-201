            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Kiengchay Gomez. I am a new <em>older</em> mom and a kid at ❤️. My son's middle 
                name comes from a popular video game. I <em>can't wait</em> until he's at the age where he wants to play so I
                can <em>use</em> him as an excuse to play, too.</p>

                        <li>I have a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Systems.</li>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My immediate goals are to build a solid foundation in software development and master at least one programming language by end of 2024. 
                The goal after that is to land a good-paying job in tech so my husband and I can move back to a big city, buy a decent size house, give our son more opportunities, 
                and live relatively comfortable into our retirement years.</p>
